# console-pray

It asks for your code to work… please. 🙏  
(It doesn’t fix anything, but at least it shows you care.)

## How does it work?

```js
require("console-pray");

console.pray();     // -> please work 🙏
```

or 

```js
const pray = require("console-pray");

pray();             // -> please work 🙏
```
